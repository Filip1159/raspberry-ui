# The Raspberry UI frontend

Hello! Welcome to my repository containing the Raspberry UI app frontend. Developed since I obtained my engineering degree in 2024, I finally decided to publish it after almost two years after implementing authentication 🔑. The project was intended to work as a home monitoring system, but I added some other features.

#### Current features :on:

- live camera stream
- GPIO interfacing the 16x2 LCD display
- Ngrok hosting. Website available at https://apt-dane-urgently.ngrok-free.app/

#### Features in progres :construction:

- websocket communnication from GPIO keypad to UI

- programmable alarm clock build with buzzer

#### Components used
